# Thumbnails plugin for Statamic

Thumbnails plugin will generate social media thumbnail images on the fly based on 
the title of a collection item available via the link shared (and description, if present). 
This will allow you to be seen on social media even if your content doesn't have imagery and thus 
increases engagement.
